## üí° Ideas & Hash Registry - Proof of Prior Existence

The **Ideas** section (`ideas.html`) provides a way to create timestamped, cryptographic proof of your creative ideas, concepts, and works using SHA-256 hashing combined with Git commit timestamps.

### How It Works

This approach uses a **public registry** (`ideas_hashes.md`) that contains:
- Idea labels/titles
- ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
- SHA-256 hashes of the full idea text

By committing the registry to GitHub, the **Git commit timestamp** combined with the **cryptographic hash** creates verifiable proof that you possessed the idea at that specific time.

### Why This Method?

1. **Cryptographically Secure**: SHA-256 hashes are one-way - you can't reverse-engineer the original text from the hash
2. **Timestamped**: Git commits are permanently timestamped and publicly visible on GitHub
3. **Private Until Revealed**: You keep the full idea text private; only the hash is public
4. **Verifiable**: Anyone can verify that your full text matches the hash when you choose to reveal it
5. **Free & Open**: No paid services required - uses standard tools (Git, OpenSSL, Node.js)

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Write Your Idea

Create a new file based on `ideas_private_template.md`:

```bash
cp ideas_private_template.md my-private-idea.md
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Keep this file LOCAL. Do NOT commit it to the public repository unless you want to make it public.

Edit the file and write your complete idea with all details.

#### 2. Compute the SHA-256 Hash

Use one of these methods:

**Method A: Using the Node.js Script (Recommended)**

```bash
node hash_ideas.js my-private-idea.md
```

**Method B: Using OpenSSL**

```bash
# For a file:
openssl dgst -sha256 my-private-idea.md

# For text directly (careful with trailing newlines):
echo -n "Your exact idea text" | openssl dgst -sha256
```

**Method C: Online Tool** (use with caution for sensitive ideas)

Visit: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html

#### 3. Add Hash to Public Registry

Open `ideas_hashes.md` and add a new entry:

```markdown
| My Brilliant Idea | 2025-10-22 | abc123def456... |
```

Replace with:
- Your idea's label (can be vague or specific - your choice)
- Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- The SHA-256 hash you just computed

#### 4. Commit and Push

```bash
git add ideas_hashes.md
git commit -m "Add hash for new idea: [your label]"
git push
```

The GitHub commit now timestamps your hash publicly!

#### 5. Verify Later

When you're ready to prove you had the idea:

1. Reveal your original private file
2. Compute its hash using the same method
3. Compare to the hash in `ideas_hashes.md`
4. Show the Git commit history to prove the timestamp

If the hashes match, it proves the content hasn't changed since the commit date.

### Enhanced Notarization with OpenTimestamps (Optional)

For even stronger proof, you can anchor your hash to the **Bitcoin blockchain** using OpenTimestamps:

#### Install OpenTimestamps

```bash
pip install opentimestamps-client
```

#### Create Timestamp Proof

```bash
# Timestamp the registry file
ots stamp ideas_hashes.md

# This creates ideas_hashes.md.ots
# Commit both files:
git add ideas_hashes.md ideas_hashes.md.ots
git commit -m "Add idea with OTS proof"
git push
```

#### Verify Timestamp

```bash
# Verify the timestamp proof
ots verify ideas_hashes.md.ots

# This checks:
# 1. The file hash matches
# 2. The Bitcoin blockchain transaction exists
# 3. The timestamp is valid
```

The `.ots` file contains a cryptographic proof that your hash existed at a specific Bitcoin block time.

### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Hash a File**

```bash
$ node hash_ideas.js my-song-idea.txt
File: my-song-idea.txt
SHA-256: 5c495ff78f5ddf387b3c9d690bf9cf00e3ef1f3c79d6d80331390084d7d79ce8
```

**Example 2: Hash from Stdin**

```bash
$ echo -n "My innovative app concept" | node hash_ideas.js
SHA-256: a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8
```

**Example 3: Interactive Mode**

```bash
$ node hash_ideas.js
Enter text (press Ctrl+D when done):
This is my creative idea that I want to protect.
[Ctrl+D]
SHA-256: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b
```

### Important Notes

**Copyright Considerations**

- Copyright protection is **automatic** in most countries upon creation of original work
- This hash registry provides **evidence of prior creation** but is not a substitute for formal copyright registration
- For music, consider also registering with:
  - **US**: US Copyright Office (copyright.gov)
  - **UK**: UK Copyright Service or UKIPO
  - **Performance Rights**: PRS for Music, ASCAP, BMI, etc.

**Best Practices**

1. **Don't commit large binary files** (like MP4s) to Git - use YouTube links instead
2. **Keep private files secure** - use encrypted storage, private repos, or offline backups
3. **Be consistent** - always use the exact same text when computing hashes
4. **Watch for newlines** - text editors may add trailing newlines that change the hash
5. **Document everything** - keep notes about what each hash represents

**Video Placeholder**

The `ideas.html` page includes a YouTube video embed with placeholder `VIDEO_ID`. Replace it with your actual remaster video:

```html
<!-- Replace VIDEO_ID with your actual YouTube video ID -->
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID" ...>
```

To find your video ID: If your video URL is `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`, the ID is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`.
