# Public idea hashes
This file contains the SHA-256 hashes of the full idea texts published on index.html. After you compute hashes locally (see README.md), paste the resulting hex digests here next to each idea title and date. The commit timestamp + hash is the public record.

Format:
- Title | ISO date | SHA-256 hex

Example entries (placeholders — replace the hash strings with real hashes you compute locally):

- MusicMates — Social for gig-going music fans | 2025-10-22 | REPLACE_WITH_SHA256_FOR_MUSICMATES_IDEA
- RJM Remaster Series | 2025-10-22 | REPLACE_WITH_SHA256_FOR_REMASTER_IDEA

Instructions:
1. Use the provided `hash_ideas.js` script or `openssl` to compute SHA-256 of the full idea text (exact text as published on index.html).
2. Update this file with the hex hash, commit, and push. The commit timestamp + the hex hash is your public proof.
3. Follow README.md for notarization with OpenTimestamps if you want an external immutable proof.
